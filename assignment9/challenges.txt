First used select element manually in Chrome Dev Inspector
and was able to identify that each of the Top 10 Elements
is located under Unordered Lis (UL) and then in list <li> 
with link with <a href> and Title under <strong> element

Construct XPATH actully was not that hard "//ul/li/a[strong]"
(similary to as absolute path in Linux)
